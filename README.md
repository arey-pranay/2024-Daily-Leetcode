I regret to inform that yesterday, I was not in the state to post an answer, A lot happened. I posted a solution on Christmas, new year, my birthday, my AWS exam, my travelling times, every damn day. But yesterday, huh, it was heartbreaking. 
So yeah, I guess I'm done.
The sadness I got from my 70 day leetcode streak getting broken is much more than any positive vibe leetcode gave me.
It is also making me think back on "streaks" as a concept. Coz just 1 mistake, and you're out. Everything bloody resets to 0.
Ugh !
No more streaks or daily practice problems. Streak is just a marketing gimmick from capitalist individuals and corporations to keep consumers addicted to their products.
BoyCotting Streaks. All of them. Leetcode, snapchat, whatever. Consistency matters, but this system is not a good tradeoff.
I like the duolingo kind of streaks, where every once in a while they give you a freeze power-up, if leetcode also starts giving it like once a month or something, then I think it'll be good.
But till then, away from streaks, focusing on progress.
I have exams from tomorrow, so after that, I'll start Striver's sheet, and dedicate at least 5 hours every day to DSA
